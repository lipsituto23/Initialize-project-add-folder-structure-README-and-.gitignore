# Initialize-project-add-folder-structure-README-and-.gitignore
Set up the repository properly so it’s ready for real development and looks professional from the start.
## Tasks
- [ ] Create basic folder structure:
  - `src/` – main source code
  - `public/` – static assets (if frontend)
  - `tests/` – unit/integration tests
  - `docs/` – documentation (optional)
- [ ] Add a proper `README.md` containing:
  - Project name & short description
  - Installation steps
  - How to run/dev the project
  - Contribution guidelines (optional)
- [ ] Add a suitable `.gitignore` (Node.js / Python / generic – let me know the stack if you have one)
- [ ] Add a license (MIT is fine for most cases)
- [ ] Make the first meaningful commit

## Result
After this issue is closed, the repo will be clean, clear, and ready for anyone to clone and start contributing immediately.

I can do it in 10–15 minutes – just assign it to me or let me know if you want something specific
